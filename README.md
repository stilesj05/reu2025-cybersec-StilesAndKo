## Project Summary
This project explores how quantum-enhanced graph optimization and dynamic trust modeling can improve the safety and efficiency of multi-agent coordination in robotics systems that rely on digital twins.  

Real-time digital twins mirror physical robots and environments but introduce new cybersecurity risks such as sensor spoofing, message tampering, and desynchronization attacks. Our goal is to build an AI-enhanced, trust-aware system that detects and responds to such attacks, ensuring safe collaboration between humans and robot teams in dynamic environments.

We are integrating models such as...
