## Project Summary
This project explores how quantum-enhanced graph optimization and dynamic trust modeling can improve the safety and efficiency of multi-agent coordination in robotics systems that rely on digital twins.  

Real-time digital twins mirror physical robots and environments but introduce new cybersecurity risks such as sensor spoofing, message tampering, and desynchronization attacks. Our goal is to build an AI-enhanced, trust-aware system that detects and responds to such attacks, ensuring safe collaboration between humans and robot teams in dynamic environments.

## Tools and Models Used:
AI Models:
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for modeling complex relationships between robots, environments, and tasks within dynamic knowledge graphs.
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for real-time task allocation and trust-aware path planning.
- TIP and ECT trust updates embedded in a live knowledge graph (robots, tasks, sensors, humans).
- Autoencoders/anomaly detection models to identify compromised data flows or adversarial manipulation.

Tools and Libraries:
- Qiskit for QAOA and other quantum needs.
- PyTorch for developing and training classical machine learning models like GNNs or autoencoders.
- Hugging Face Transformers for integrating LLM -based reasoning into agent decisions or knowledge graph summarization.
- NetworkX/DGL for graph-based modeling of robots, environments, and trust relationships.
- Digital Twin Platforms (simulation, Unity3D specifically) to represent the physical-virtual interaction part of this project.

## Setup Instructions
- TBD
